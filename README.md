Practice OOP by making a Randomized Thanksgiving Guest List

Objective:
The objective of this exercise is to create a Python script that randomizes a Thanksgiving guest list by assigning each guest a dish from the Thanksgiving menu. The script utilizes a class structure and includes methods to shuffle the list of dishes, print the randomized guest list, and practice printing individual objects of the class.

Instructions:
1. Thanksgiving Menu:
   - The exercise begins with a predefined list of Thanksgiving menu items, such as turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, etc.

2. Create a Class:
   - Define a class named `ThanksgivingGuestList` with methods to initialize the class, randomize the guest list, print the guest list, and print individual guest-dish assignments.

3. Randomize Guest List:
   - Implement a method within the class that shuffles the list of Thanksgiving menu items and assigns each dish to a fictional guest.

4. Print Guest List:
   - Develop a method to print out the randomized guest list in a readable format, showing each guest and their assigned dish.

5. Print Individual Objects:
   - Practice printing individual objects of the class by creating an instance of the class, randomizing the guest list, and printing the dish assigned to a specific guest.

6. Run the Script:
   - Instantiate the class, randomize the guest list, and print the results.

7. Experiment:
   - Modify the script, such as adding more menu items, introducing additional languages for dish names, or exploring different ways to display the results.

Example Output:
The output should include not only the randomized Thanksgiving guest list but also the ability to print individual guest-dish assignments. This allows students to practice accessing and displaying information about specific instances of the class.

Guest 1: macaroni and cheese
